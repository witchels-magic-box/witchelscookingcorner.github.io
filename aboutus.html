			 		<article>
			 			<p>
			 			Hi everybody and Welcome! :) I am Aishy the so called chef of this website and a web developer behind Home Cooking Adventure.</p>
			 			<img src="me.jpg"/>


<p>
I started this blog/website in the winter of 2015 to share with you my passion for cooking through my little adventures in the kitchen. I find cooking relaxing, I love talking with friends and family about food and sharing recipes. I started to love cooking mostly because home cooked food is fresher, better and healthier. It seems that nowadays it has become a luxury few can afford. Our lives seem overwhelmingly busy and "fast-food" is a common term in this hectic world.</p>

<p>

I discovered that I feel challenged by trying to make food from scratch, like learning to make bread without yeast, making my own pastry dough instead of buying, I discovered that I really enjoy working with flour therefore baking is one of my favorite parts of cooking.</p>


<p>
I believe that cooking is for everybody. It might take time but it is an adventure, a wild ride, a rewarding and delightful experience that will soon turn into a captivating pleasure.
</p>
<p>
I have the luck of having the full support of my mom who taught me many recipies i included in this blog </p>


<p>
In my private life I am a computer science and engineering student and from my passion of web developing i designed this site all by myself just to warm a little bit up before i dig into the serious world of web developing</p>


<p>
This blog was meant from the beginning as a possibility to share good and as much as possible healthy recipes and good information related to food. It's not a blog about my personal life, I like to restrict my posts specific to that recipe story. English is not my native language, so be indulgent with me if any errors occur. I would appreciate if you notice any mistake to just let me know:).
</p>

<p>
All in all, Home Cooking Adventure is about the passion me and my mom share for excellent flavours, freshly pounded spices, decadent sweets and savory dishes. We want to introduce new creative ways to cook and show how you can have a blast in the kitchen. Hope you will enjoy these recipes as much as we do.
</p>


<p>
Keep on cooking</p>
