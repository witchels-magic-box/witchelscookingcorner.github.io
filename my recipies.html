<h3> Kacchi Biriyani </h3>

<article>

Please be careful not to burn the spices. This 'is 'the most important ingredients of the biryani.
STEP TWO
Wash and clean the mutton. Marinate with 2 tbsp salt and keep aside for half an hour.
After half and hour wash the mutton once more and keep.
Now add the yogurt , ginger paste, garlic paste , 4 tbsp brown onion slices and the biryani masala. Mix it very well and gently too.
Cover this mixture with a cling film and let it marinate overnight.
STEP THREE
Take 2 cups of good quality basmati rice. Wash it under running water , drain and keep aside.
In a big saucepan add water. Once the water starts to boil add 2 tbsp salt and few whole cardamom , cloves and cinnamon.
Next add the rice and let it boil till the rice is almost half done.
Strain the rice and spread it out on a flat surface.
STEP FOUR
Now is probably the easiest part and the last step' assembling' before you can devour this sinful biryani.
Take a handi or a saucepan (make sure it has a proper lid) and brush it with a little ghee.
We will make the first layer with rice and then the mutton.
First rice,then the marinated mutton and fried potatoes , then rice and then mutton again. Finally top it up with the remaining rice. Sprinkle the remaining brown onion slices and the kewra essence on top. Close the lid tightly of the handi and seal it with the dough
Now the final task is to put this on dum or slow cooking as we say. For the mutton to be fully cooked this has to be put on heat for at least an hour. So to prevent it from burning I always put the handi on a tawa/skillet and not directly.
Now forget about it for an hour and then when you break open that seal - simply divine!!</article>
